# Unsold Desklog Recovery ROI Modeling Tool

A multi-step wizard that lets dealers input their own numbers and discover the ROI of AI-powered desklog recovery. The tool uses strategic messaging and tooltips to guide their thinking without telling them what to conclude.

## Step 1: Your Dealership Today
**Let them establish their baseline with pride**

**Inputs:**
- Monthly UPs (walk-in traffic)
- Current Close Rate % (slider 15-40%, default 25%)

**Live Display:**
- Customers Closed
- **Unsold Customers** (large, highlighted number)

**Tooltip on Close Rate:** "Industry average is 20-25%. Top performers hit 30%+"

**Bottom Message:** "Nice work getting [X] customers through your doors. That's real marketing dollars at work."

---

## Step 2: Where Do the Unsold Go?
**Plant the seed - these are buyers, not tire-kickers**

**Input:**
- "What % of your unsold customers will buy a vehicle somewhere in the next 90 days?" (slider 30-70%, default 50%)

**Live Display:**
- Number who will buy elsewhere
- Estimated lost gross (using industry average until they input their own later)

**Tooltip:** "Studies show 85% of dealership visitors buy within 90 days. The only question is where."

**Message:** "You invested to get [750] people on your lot. [375] of them are about to buy from someone else."

---

## Step 3: Your Current Follow-Up
**Let them confront reality without accusation**

**Input (honest self-assessment):**
- "What % of your unsold customers get a follow-up call within 48 hours?" (slider 0-100%, default 20%)
- "Of those called, what % actually connect with a decision-maker?" (slider 10-50%, default 25%)

**Tooltip on first question:** "Be honest—this is your model. Most stores are under 30%."

**Thought-provoking cards (they can click to expand):**
- "Why follow-up falls through the cracks" → Understaffed, other priorities, no accountability
- "The caller bias problem" → Same person who lost the deal now calls with assumptions: "they're just shopping"
- "The customer's memory" → They remember the experience. A fresh voice changes everything.

**Message:** "Most stores call fewer than 10% of unsold traffic. Zero call everyone to find out why they didn't buy."

---

## Step 4: What If You Called Everyone?
**The AI agent funnel - let them model the possibility**

**Inputs (with smart defaults and guidance):**
- % of unsold reached by AI (default 55%) — Tooltip: "AI calls at optimal times, leaves voicemails, sends texts. No lunch breaks."
- % of reached who book an appointment (default 25%) — Tooltip: "The AI identifies their objection and addresses it. No ego, no assumptions."
- Appointment show rate (default 75%) — Tooltip: "They agreed to come back. They're motivated."
- Close rate on returners (default = their original close rate) — Tooltip: "Think about it: same or higher? They came back for a reason."

**Visual Funnel:**
Shows numbers flowing down:
750 Unsold → 413 Reached → 103 Booked → 77 Showed → **[X] Additional Sales**

**Message:** "No excuses. No bias. No 'they seemed like a mooch.' Just a conversation to find out what went wrong and fix it."

## Step 5: The Money
**Let the numbers speak**

**Inputs:**
- Average gross profit per deal (front + back) — default $3,500
- Monthly tool cost — pre-filled $2,000

**Results Dashboard:**
- **Additional Units/Month:** [X]
- **Additional Gross Profit:** $[X]
- **Tool Investment:** $2,000
- **Net Monthly Profit:** $[X] (big, green)
- **ROI:** [X]x return (very prominent)
- **Annual Impact:** $[X]

**Comparison visual:**
| Do Nothing | With AI Agent |
|------------|---------------|
| 0 recovered | [X] recovered |
| $0 | $[X] profit |

**Message:** "These are your numbers. Your close rate. Your gross. Your opportunity."

## Strategic Tooltips & Messages Throughout

**Discovery-focused language:**
- "What do YOU think happens to..."
- "Based on YOUR numbers..."

**Gentle challenges:**
